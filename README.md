## Research
### Clinical Research Coordinator - [MGH DARPA SUBNETS](https://transformdbs.partners.org/?q=transform-dbs), Massachusetts General Hospital
##### June, 2014 - May, 2017
* Devised hierarchical Bayesian model of decision making conflict, integrating both choice and reaction time data, for an approach/avoidance gambling task and applied the resulting subject-specific predictors to characterize conflict resolution in neural circuitry in fMRI & EEG datasets. [(Github)](https://github.com/szorowi1/JNeurosci_ARC)
* Lead analyst on study investigating the neural correlates of diminished cautiousness during a Stroop-like task in patients undergoing deep-brain stimulation for major depressive disorder using source-localized EEG data. [(Github)](https://github.com/szorowi1/EMOTE-afMSIT)
* Adapted Bayesian state space models of associative learning to a reversal learning paradigm and demonstrated its efficacy in improving fMRI signal-to-noise ratio.
* Created tutorials and other guides for lab members on numerous technical and statistical topics, including fMRI and M/EEG analysis, non-parametric permutation testing, and graph theory.

### Research Assistant - Johns Hopkins University
##### June, 2013 - May, 2014
With Colin Wilson & John Kruschke:
* Designed a novel paradigm examining the role of prospective and retrospective counterfactual reasoning in judgments of responsibility, blame, and economic fairness, and analyzed subsequent data using simple computational models.
* Established protocol for online participant recruitment and data management utilizing Amazon Mechanical Turk.
* Implemented Bayesian models, including hierarchical mediation analysis, for analyzing data with R and JAGS.

With Jared Lorince:
* Modeled the role of social imitation in tagging behaviors across the social networks of two million users of an online
music-archiving community (Last.fm).

### Lecturer - [Why & How Series](https://gate.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/wiki/whynhow/index.php/Main_Page), Martinos Center 
##### November, 2016
* Invited to present an Introduction to Scientific Python lecture as part of a tutorial lecture series.
* Designed novel materials to introduce Python for neuroscience, including examples on statistics, visualization, and imaging data manipulation.

### Intern Mentor - Harvard Catalyst Clinical Research Center Summer Internship
##### Summers 2015, 2016
* Volunteered twice as mentor for student (initials: KL) as part of the Harvard CCRC Summer Internship program.
* Oversaw student KL in her efforts to analyze differences in EEG resting state spectral content in patients with DBS turned on and off.
* Guided returned student KL in her efforts to apply per-trial estimates of decision conflict to EEG data from an approach-avoidance gambling task.

### Study Consultant - Johns Hopkins University 
##### September, 2013 - May, 2014
* Coached six undergraduate students in effective academic habits through Office of Academic Advising.
* Worked with students to improve organizational abilities, note-taking skills, schedule planning, and study habits.
