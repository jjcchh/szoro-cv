## Research
### Clinical Research Coordinator - [MGH DARPA SUBNETS](https://transformdbs.partners.org/?q=transform-dbs), Massachusetts General Hospital
##### June, 2014 - May, 2017
* Devised hierarchical Bayesian model of [decision making conflict](https://github.com/szorowi1/JNeurosci_ARC), integrating both choice and reaction time data, for an approach/avoidance gambling task and applied the resulting subject-specific predictors to characterize conflict resolution in neural circuitry in fMRI & EEG datasets.
* Adapted Bayesian state space models of associative learning to a reversal learning paradigm and demonstrated its efficacy in improving fMRI signal-to-noise ratio.
* Lead analyst on [study](https://github.com/szorowi1/EMOTE-afMSIT) investigating the neural correlates of diminished cautiousness during a Stroop-like task in patients undergoing deep-brain stimulation for major depressive disorder using source-localized EEG data.
* Created tutorials and other guides for lab members on numerous technical and statistical topics, including fMRI and M/EEG analysis, non-parametric permutation testing, and graph theory.

### Research Assistant, - Johns Hopkins University
##### June, 2013 - May, 2014
With Colin Wilson & John Kruschke:
* Designed a novel paradigm examining the role of prospective and retrospective counterfactual reasoning in judgments of responsibility, blame, and economic fairness, and analyzed subsequent data using simple computational models.
* Established protocol for online participant recruitment and data management utilizing Amazon Mechanical Turk.
* Implemented Bayesian models, including hierarchical mediation analysis, for analyzing data with R and JAGS.
With Jared Lorince:
* Modeled the role of social imitation in tagging behaviors across the social networks of two million users of an online
music-archiving community (Last.fm).
* Quantified user expertise in online tagging behaviors using the HITS and SPEAR algorithms.
With Marc Boulay:
* Investigated social and sexual network risks of HIVstatus in MSM populations in Abuja and Lagos, Nigeria.
* Preprocessed data using multiple imputations and conducted exploratory factor analysis and multilevel modeling.

### Visiting Undergraduate Research Fellow - Indiana University
##### August, 2012 - May, 2013
With John Kruschke:
* Assisted in follow-up experiments analyzing the role of luck and chance in prosocial judgments and punitive behaviors
in players of a modified public goods game.
* Learned to analyze collected data with Bayesian modeling using R and JAGS.
* Performed literature reviews and assisted in preparing grant applications and IRBproposals
